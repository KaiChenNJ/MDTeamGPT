# MDTeamGPT: A Self-Evolving LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Disciplinary Team Medical Consultation


## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields. However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations. Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience. Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories, increasing the modelâ€™s cognitive burden and degrading both efficiency and accuracy.

To address these challenges, we propose **MDTeamGPT**, a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs. Our framework employs:

- **Consensus aggregation and residual discussion structures** for multi-round consultations.
- **Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB)** and **Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB)** to accumulate consultation experience.
- A self-evolving mechanism that enhances diagnosis rationality and accuracy.

## Features

- Multi-agent framework for **MDT medical consultations**.
- Role-based **reasoning, task decomposition, and collaborative decision-making**.
- Efficient knowledge retention via **CorrectKB and ChainKB**.
- Continuous self-improvement and error reflection.

## Experimental Results

Our framework achieves **state-of-the-art** performance on benchmark datasets:

| Dataset   | Accuracy |
|-----------|---------:|
| MedQA     | 90.1%    |
| PubMedQA  | 83.9%    |

The constructed knowledge bases demonstrate effective generalization across different test sets.
